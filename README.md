# CodeAlpha_ChatBot
This project is a simple text-based chatbot developed using the spaCy and NLTK libraries. The chatbot is designed to interact with users by recognizing entities in their input and responding with predefined messages. Here’s a quick rundown of its features and functionality:

Features:
Entity Recognition: Utilizes spaCy to identify entities in user inputs.
Predefined Responses: Provides specific answers to common questions and default responses to unrecognized inputs.
Sentiment Analysis: Incorporates NLTK’s VADER sentiment analyzer to assess the sentiment of user inputs.
User Interaction: Engages in basic conversation, tells jokes, shares fun facts, and more.
This project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing techniques to create a basic yet functional chatbot. It serves as a foundation for more advanced conversational agents and provides a practical application of spaCy and NLTK libraries.
